# JottaX
JottaX is a simple GUI client to download files from Jottacloud for Linux. JottaX supports logins from Jottacloud, Elkj√∏p Cloud and Lefdal Cloud. More branches will be added in the future. This project is still in development, so don't download or test anything yet. Let me know if you're a developer and want to contribute as well. I'm currently working on this project on my own.


### Preview (will be updated continuously):
